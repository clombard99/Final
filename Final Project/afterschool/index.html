 <p>The Playful Wonders After School Program provides a safe, happy, caring and wholesome environment for children between five and ten years of age. This program was started in September 1986 by Mary O'Connell, a retired certified teacher. She realized that there was a great need for quality after school care in the Pelham area. Most of the children who attend this program have parents that work full time. We also cater to your individual needs with flexible scheduling.<br />
   <br />
Our After School Program helps bridge that time from when the school day has ended to when parents return home from work. The program begins at 3:00 PM and ends at 6:00 PM. We are in session from September to June operating five days a week.  We follow the Pelham school calendar as to when we are closed for holidays and snow days during the year. On the early release days during the year (Oct. thru May) we will have an extended day from 12:00 noon to 6:00 PM <br />
<br />
Our program is currently located in the Siwanoy School, 489 Siwanoy Place, in Pelham Manor, NY. Transportation is provided from the Pelham Schools to our center. Our teacher to child ratio is about 1 to 6. This enables us to take time to work with children in small groups thus providing the caring environment which we strive for. The program provides nutritious snacks, educational group activities, indoor and outdoor games, and supervision with homework. We provide many creative activities for children including arts and crafts, dramatizing stories, science experiments, music and movement, board games and a variety of building toys. Our outdoor games and activities give children the opportunity to release stored up energy after a day at school. Our teachers assist children during homework time as well as checking homework assignments. On the Pelham School's early release days the children have the opportunity to attend our exciting and educational field trips. Bowling, Ice Skating, The NRHS Planetarium and the Greenburgh Nature Center are just few of the places our After School Program has visited. </p>

         <span class="small">
         <p><em>Dear Mary, Mrs. Glynn &amp; the After School Program,<br /><br />
           I just wanted to write a note  to thank you for the many years of after school care for my children. </em><em>As a working mom, it was wonderful not to be stressed, and to know that I did not have worry about my children after school. I know that they were being taken care of, safe and having fun! </em>         </p>
         <p><em>As always, I will recommend your program to parents!</em></p>
         <p><em>Thanks again, Sincerely,</em></p>
